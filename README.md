# hello-world

Hi everyone.

Bartek here. I am new in modern programing and IT. I did some TurboPascal, very little C years ago and some PLC programing. Now I work as a soldier, but I wish to start a new episode in life and go back to my interest from studies (AGH Cracow - Mecatronics and Robotics). I hope it is a good place to start.
